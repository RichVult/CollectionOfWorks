# CollectionOfWorks
GUIDE TO THIS REPO

Each folder is a collection of works that I have done, some in groups, others by myself, seperated by which class I did them for.

A breif description of each folder

IntroDataScience - This was an intro level data class, in the folder you will find code in R, and our findings organized. This was inteded to be a group project of 4-5 students, but it ended up being done entirely by me and one other person. We were provided a place to collect our data, we consrtucted a hypothesis, then performed a variety of tests. Finally consolidated all of our findings then presented our conclusion to the professor and the class.

DatabaseManagement - This was a higher level class focused on interacting more directly with databases and was done mostly in SQL. I was one in a group of six for this, so a smaller portion of the code is actually mine. This class gave me experience with MySQL and working in larger groups.

IntroPython - This class was a very basic introduction into python, this folder contains all of the labs we worked on, this is was a personal repo so all work is my own.

SDII - This was a higher level software development class
