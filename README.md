# CollectionOfWorks

Each folder is a collection of works that I have done, some in groups, others by myself, seperated by which class I did them for.

IntroPython - This class was a very basic introduction into python, this folder contains all of the labs we worked on, this is was a personal repo so all work is my own.

Algorithms - This a 400 level class I am currently taking this semester, Fall of 2025. It focuses on
