# CollectionOfWorks
GUIDE TO THIS REPO

Each folder is a collection of works that I have done, some in groups, others by myself, seperated by which class I did them for.

A brief description of each folder

IntroDataScience - This was an intro level data class, in the folder you will find code in R, and our findings organized. This was intended to be a group project of 4-5 students, but it ended up being done entirely by me and one other person. We were provided a place to collect our data, we constructed a hypothesis, then performed a variety of tests. Finally consolidated all of our findings then presented our conclusion to the professor and the class.

DatabaseManagement - This was a higher level class focused on interacting more directly with databases and was done mostly in SQL. I was one in a group of six for this, so a smaller portion of the code is actually mine. This class gave me experience with MySQL and working in larger groups.

IntroPython - This class was a very basic introduction into python, this folder contains all of the labs we worked on, this was a personal repo so all work is my own.

SDII - This was a higher level software development class, I was one in a group of seven so only a proportion of the work is my own. For this project we were provided a client who wanted a piece of software, all groups got something different, our client wanted a food delivery app. My group worked together to delegate the work between us and provide a finished product in the time allotted to us. We worked with a database through Postgres and hosted our webpage locally. SQL, java, CSS, and HTML were used. 

Algorithms - This a 400 level class I am currently taking this semester, Fall of 2025. It focuses on algorithms, problem-solving techniques and data structures. Specifically how to approach problems in the most efficient way possible, by going over all the different possible ways to solve an issue, and how to select the best. The assignments are in java, and all of this work is my own.
